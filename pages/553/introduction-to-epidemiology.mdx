# {title}

- Greek **epi** - on, upon, to; **demos** - people; **logos** - knowledge, doctrine, science
- the study of the occurance, distribution, determinants of health problems and diseases in human populations and use of this knowledge for the prevention and control of disease

## Historical Definitions
- **Frost**, 1927 - the science of the mass phenomena of infectious diseases or the natural history of infectious diseases
- **Stally Brass**, 1931 - the science of infective diseases, their prime causes, propagation and prevention
- **Greenwood**, 1935 - the study of disease, any disease as a mass phenomenon
- **Lumsden**, 1936 - The study of condition known or reasonably supposed to influence the prevalence of disease

## Modern Definition

- **JM Last**, 1988 - Study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in the specified populations and the application of this study to control of health problems

## Types
1. Geographic epidemiology
1. Clinical epidemiology
1. Identification of agents of disease
1. Statistical epidemiology
1. Descriptive epidemiology and field surveyy
1. Analytical epidemiology
1. Experimental epidemiology
1. Infectious disease epidemiology
1. Administrative prevention, control and treatment of disease

## Aims of Epidemiology
1. to describe and analyze disease occurrence and distribution in human populations
1. to identify aetiological factors (risk factors) in the pathogenesis of disease
1. to provide the data essential for the planning, implementation and evaluation of services for the prevention, control and treatment of diseases and to the setting up of priorities among those services

### Ultimate aim
1. To eliminate or reduce the health problems or its consequences
1. To promote the health and well-being of a society as a whole

## Uses
1. In earlier days
    - limited to find out the causes of communicable diseases
1. Nowadays
    - to study the influence of genetic and environmental factors in human disease and preventive intervention through health promotion

### Specific Uses
1. Investigation of causation of disease
1. Study of natural history and prognosis of the disease
1. Description of health status of populations (proportions of ill health, changes of disease pattern over time, age, geography etc.)
1. Evaluation of interventions (preventive and therapeutic) and health problems
1. Planning of health services, public policies and programs
1. To study the working of health services, determination of needs and resources, proceed for analyses of services in action

## What the epidemiologist determines
1. Frequencies patterns of disease
1. Aetiology/cause of disease
1. Modes of transmission
1. Factors of susceptibility, exposure and risk
1. Environmental determinants

## Activities in epidemiology
1. Investigation and control of disease outbreaks
1. Study of environmental and industrial hazards
1. Evaluation of new preventive or curative clinical treatment and intervention
1. Determination of the health needs of the populations
1. Evaluation of the effectiveness of health services

## Three essential components of epidemiology
1. **Disease distribution** How are cases of the condition of interest spread across a population differently by gender, age, geographic location, socio-economic status, other features?
1. **Disease determination** What risk factors or antecedent events are associated with the appearance of a disease or condition?
1. **Disease frequency** How many cases of the condition occur over a given time period?

## Epidemiological approaches
1. **Descriptive epidemiology**
    1. Type of disease or helath problem (What)
    1. Person (Who)
    1. Place (Where)
    1. Time (When)
1. **Analytical epidemiology**
    - Evaluation of the determinants of disease distribution in terms of possible causal factors
        1. Case control study
        1. Cohort study
1. **Experimental epidemiology**
