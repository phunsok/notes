## Functions

- processes food
- extracts nutrients
- eliminates residue

## Five stages
- ingestion
- digestion
- absroption
- compaction (absorb water, consolidate undigested residue into faeces)
- defaecation

## Types of digestion
- Mechanical digestion
- Chemical digestion

## General Histology
- from inner to outer

    ### 1. Mucosa
    - lines the **lumen**
    - consists of
        - inner epithelium
            - stratified squamous: oral cavity to oesophagus, lower anal canal
            - simple columnar: stomach to large intestine
        - **lamina propria** (loose connective tissue)
        - thin layer of smooth muscle
    - **mucosa-associated lynphatic tissue (MALT)**

    ### 2. Submucosa
    - loose connective tissue
    - contains blood vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerves

    ### 3. Muscularis externa
    - smooth muscles in two layers, three in stomach
    - inner circular layer, outer longitudinal layer
    - responsible for motility

    ### 4. Serosa
    - from lower 3-4cm of oesophagus to just before rectum
    - pharynx, most of oesophagus an oesophagus and rectum are covered by fibrous connective tissue - **adventitia** that blends into connective tissue of adjacent organs
    - areolar tissue covered by simple squamous epithelium

## Anatomy

### 1. Digestive Tract
- alimentary canal
- about 5m long

#### Mouth
#### Pharynx
#### Oesophagus
#### Stomach
#### Small intestine
#### Large intestine

### 2. Accessory Organs
- Teeth
- Tongue
- Salivary glands
- Liver
- Gall bladder
- Pancreas
