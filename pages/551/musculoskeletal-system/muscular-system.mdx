## Functions

- **movement** - support the viscera and muscles; maxilla and mandible support teeth
- **stability** - protect the brain, spinal cord, lungs, heart, pelvic viscera
- **control of body openings and passages** - provide attachment and leverage for muscular system; allow limb movement, ventilate lungs
- **heat generation** - produce 30% of body heat at rest and upto 40x as much during exercise
- **glycemic control** - muscles absorb large share of blood glucose, perform glucose-buffering function

## Skeletal muscle

- **voluntary**, **striated**(alternating light and dark transverse bands- **striations**) muscle
- reflect overlapping arrangement of internal proteins that enable it to contract
- usually attached to one or more bones
- cells are internally complex and tightly arranged
- **skeletal muscle fibre
    - long slender shapes- **fibres**
    - typically ~100µm thick, 3cm long
    - can be 500µm thick, 30cm long
    - **sarcolemma** - plasma membrane
        - tunnel-like infoldings into **transverse (T) tubules** which carry electrical current inside the fibre
    - multiple nuclei pressed against inner plasma membrane
    - **myofibrils**
        - thick bundle of contractile protein deeper in the fibre
        - several dozen to few thousands
    - numerous mitochondria, network of smooth ER **sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)**, glycogen deposits, myoglobin (red oxygen-binding pigment) packed between myofibrils
    - SR forms web around myofibril
        - forms dilated sacs called **terminal cisterns** along with T tubules
        - reservoir for Ca ions; floods Ca into cytoplasm when fibre is stimulated
