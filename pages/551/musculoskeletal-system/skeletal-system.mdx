# Skeletal System

- **osteology** - study of bones
- **arthrology** - study of joints
- **kinesiology** -  study of musculoskeletal movement
- composed of **bones**, **cartilages** and **ligaments** joined tightly to form a strong, flexible, framework
- **cartilage** - precursor of bones in embryonic development
- **ligament** - collagenous bands that hold bones together at joints
- **tendon** - attach muscle to bone, structurally similar to ligaments

## Functions

- **support** - support the viscera and muscles; maxilla and mandible support teeth
- **protection** - protect the brain, spinal cord, lungs, heart, pelvic viscera
- **movement** - provide attachment and leverage for muscular system; allow limb movement, ventilate lungs
- **blood formation** - red bone marrow
- **storage** - reservoir of Ca, P and other minerals; fatty bone marrow serves as reserves of stored fuel
- pneumatic bones of skull make it lighter and provides resonance to voice

## Bone Tissue

- hard, calcified tissue of bone - **osseous tissue**
- **two** forms:
    - **compact** (dense) bone
        - solidly filled w/ opaque matrix
        - outer shell surrounding spongy bone
        - prevents bone marrow from seeping out and provides sollid attachment surfaces for muscles, tendons and ligaments
        - at surface, arranged into parallel layers laid down by surface osteoblasts
        - deeper, organized into cylindrical units - **osteons** (layers - **lamellae** around a central canal); central canal has small blood vessels and nerves; innermost osteocytes receive nutrients from bloodstream and pass them along to remote osteocytes; wates travel in the opposite direction
        - Haversian system
    - **spongy / cancellous** bone
        - porous lattice of **trabeculae** (slender rods and plates) honeycombed w/ spaces filled w/ bone marrow and small blood vessels
        - impart strength w/o adding too much weight
- consists of cells and matrix

### 1. Bone Cells

1. **Osteogenic cells / osteoprogenitor cells**
    - occur on bone surface beneath the fibrous connective tissue membrane that covers the bone
    - stem cells
    - give rise to osteoblasts
    - only bone cells capable of dividing and making more bone cells
2. **Osteoblasts**
    - develop from osteogenic cells
    - single layer on bone surface, resembling cuboidal epithelium
    - synthesizes organic matter of bone and deposit matrix
    - numerous mitochondria and RER
3. **Osteocytes**
    - mature bone cells
    - osteoblasts that have become trapped in the matrix they deposited
    - reside in cavities- **lacunnae**, which are connected to each other by slender channels- **canaliculi**
    - have delicate cytoplasmic membranes that reach into the canaliculi to meet those of neighbouring osteocytes
    - pass nutrients, wastes, and chemical signals to each other through gaps junctions at tips of cytoplasmic processes
4. **Osteoclasts**
    - bone-dissolving cells
    - develop from separate line of bone marrow stem cells
    - very large (upto 150μm diameter)
    - multiple nuclei
    - lie on bone surface like osteoblasts
    - often in pits that have eroded into the bone surface
    - unusual comb-like infoldings of the plasma membrane - **ruffled border**
    - cells secrete HCl and enzymes to dissolve osseous tissue from ruffled border

### 2. Bone Matrix

- stony matter that surrounds osteocytes and lacunae
- 1/3 organic matter (mainly collagen)
- 2/3 inorganic (mainly Ca(PO₄)₂)
- composite material - provide flexibility and strength
- minerals resist compression; childhood **rickets** and adult **osteomalacia** - mineral deficiency
- collagen resist tension

## Bone
- living, vascular, supportive connective tissue

### Periosteum and Endosteum

- **periosteum** - fibrous sheath covering bone
    - collagen fibres penetrate into bone itself and are continuous with tendons; provide strong attachment and continuity from muscle to tendon to bone
    - not present over articular cartilage
- **endosteum** - lines internal surface
    - thin layer of reticular connective tissue separating bone from bone marrow

### Bone marrow

- **Red bone marrow**
    - contains stem cells that produce red blood cells and platelets
    - fills nearly every bone of child’s skeleton, limited in adults
    - consists of soft, structured network of delicate blood vessels surronded by reticular tissues and islands of blood-forming cells
- **Yellow bone marrow**
    - contains stem cells that produce cartilage, fats and bone
    - much of red bone marrow is replaced by yellow bone marrow as we mature and dominates long limb bone cells

### A. On the basis of shape and size

#### 1. Long bones
- in limbs, for leverage and movement
- the elongated midsection is the **diaphysis/shaft** and each expanded end is the **epiphysis/head**
- diaphysis privides leverage; epiphysis provides added surface area for attaching tendons and ligament
- head and nearby shaft has spongy bone
- bone marrow is in **medullary cavity** of shaft and spaces in spongy bone
- **epiphysial lines** mark former growth zones of child’s bone
- ends where two bones meet are covered w/ hyaline cartilage called **articular cartilage**, eases joint movements
- e.g. humerus, femur, radius, ulna, tibia, fibula, phalanges, metacarpals, metatarsals

#### 2. Short bones
- cuboidal
- e.g. carpals, tarsals

#### 3. Flat bones
- for protection e.g. sternum, cranial bones
- for attachment e.g. scapula, hip bones
- two layer of compact bones enclose a spongy bone

#### 4. Irregular bones
- e.g. hip bones, vertebrae, facial bones

#### 5. Sesamoid bones
- round or oval
- develop in relation to tendons
- ossified after birth
- no periosteum
- e.g. patella (within the quadriceps tendon), pisiform (within the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris)

### B. On the basis of location

#### 2. Cartilagenous bone

## Joints
- articulation

### 1. Fibrous joints / synarthrosis
- adjacent bones are connected by collagen fibres from their matrices
- low or no movement
- e.g. sutures of skull, tooth-jaw bone joint, radio-ulnar joint, tibio-fibular joint

### 2. Cartilagenous joints / amphiarthrosis
- linked by cartilage
- e.g. pubic symphysis, intervertebral joints (discs), rib 1 to sternum (hyaline costal cartilage)

### 3. Synovial joints / diarthrosis
- most movable
- structurally complex
- adjacent bones are separated by a narrow space - *articular cavity* containing a slippery lubricant - *synovial fluid*
- the ends of bones are covered by articular cartilage
- e.g. shoulder, elbow, hip, knee, carpals and tarsals
